abstract = "Float glass, a common type of glass used in windows and doors, can be important evidence in the investigation of a crime. If fragments are optically indistinguishable, they may be distinguishable in their chemical compositions, which can be measured using inductively coupled mass spectrometry with a laser add-on (LA-ICP-MS) [14]. If the measurements are “similar enough” then the recovered fragment is indistinguishable from the crime scene glass [1]. Recently, Park and Carriquiry [10] proposed using machine learning methods to establish probabilistic source conclusions for glass, and found that these methods have lower classification error than traditional methods. Using an experimental database of glass elemental concentrations to simulate different forensic scenarios, we examine the results from two different classifiers to understand why learning algorithms appear to outperform traditional methods when making source conclusions for forensic float glass questions. By analyzing each step in the recommended ASTM decision process, we conclude that the standard ASTM method is not the optimum and that more data are required to determine a better comparison rule for source conclusions based on the chemical makeup of float glass."

abstract = "We measured the elemental chemical composition of architectural float glass fragments using inductively coupled mass spectrometry with a laser ablation add-in. Measurements of 18 elemental concentrations were obtained from each fragment at each measurement occasion. These data can be used for statistical analysis with the purpose of evaluating forensic trace evidence. The data collection and measurement process in this database were carefully designed by the authors to enable understanding similarities and differences in elemental composition within a fragment, between fragments within a pane, between panes produced by the same manufacturer, and between manufacturers, to help in forensic glass evaluation. We received 48 panes that were produced on consecutive days, from two glass manufacturers in the U.S. Half of each pane was broken into small fragments and 24 fragments were randomly sampled from each half pane. To compute well-conditioned estimates of high-dimensional covariance matrices at all levels, we replicated measurements on each fragment; for three of the 24 fragments from a pane, we obtained 20 replicate measurements, and for the other 21 fragments, we made five replicate measurements. Analytical procedures to carry out the measurements followed the protocols recommended for forensic float glass samples by ENFSI [1] and the ASTM [2]. The database described in this article is related to two published research articles, “Learning algorithms to evaluate forensic glass evidence” by Park and Carriquiry (2019) [3] and “Evaluation and comparison of methods for forensic glass source conclusions” by Park and Tyner (2019) [4]."
